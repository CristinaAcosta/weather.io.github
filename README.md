## Description:

Here I created a basic weather forecasting site. The user is able to search for a city and get daily information on the weather. This includes the temperature, humidity and wind speed. The user is also able to retrieve a five day weather forecast that includes just the temperature and the humidity.

## Technologies Used:

- API
- HTML/CSS

## Things we learned:

- I learned how to better use an API and how to insert the API into a HTML document. I was unable to retreive just the city but managed to somewhat save all the previous city information.
